# Description

Allows content to be injected before, within and after the loop. All content is configurable via an admin settings page.

Each of the three content locations can be activated individually and the location within the loop is configurable; perfect for injecting adverts. Shortcodes are supported in Loop Injection.

This plugin is multisite compatible; each site will need settings to be configured in the admin dashboard.
