![Plugin Banner](/assets/pluginimages/banner-1544x500.png)

# Description

Allows content to be injected before, within and after the loop. All content is configurable via an admin settings page.

Each of the three content locations can be activated individually and the location within the loop is configurable; perfect for injecting adverts. Shortcodes are supported in Loop Injection.

This plugin is multisite compatible; each site will need settings to be configured in the admin dashboard.

# Installation Instructions

 * Upload the entire zip file using the Plugins upload function in your ClassicPress admin panel.
 * Activate the plugin.
 * Configure relevant settings via the configuration page in the admin control panel (azurecurve menu).
